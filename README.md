# Automated Lexer

A simple lexer made with Jflex

## Requirements

- Java 8 (or higher)
- Maven

## Build

To build source files, type

> mvn generate-sources

To compile, type

> mvn compile

This project is provided with a simple *bash* script to compile and test it. To use the script type

> bash start.sh TESTFILE_PATH

The script will parse the testfile at *TESTFILE_PATH*, printing each token it recognize to standard output.

## Structure

This is a Lexer written in `flex` and compiled with `Jflex` (an open source tool for generating Lexer in Java), for a toy programming language.  

It is composed of a single `Lexer.flex` source file contaning all the logic to generate a Lexer.  

### Lexemes

This Lexer implementation recognizes the following Tokens:  

- *Delimiters*
- *Keywords*
- *Identifiers*
- *Literals*
  - *Int*
  - *Float*
- *Separators (like brackets, colon etc.)*
- *Operators* 
- *String*

To recognize these tokens, the following regexs have been defined:

- ALPHA=[A-Za-z]
- DIGIT=[0-9]
- NONZERO_DIGIT=[1-9]
- NEWLINE=\r|\n|\r\n
- WHITESPACE = {NEWLINE} | [ \t\f]
- ID = {ALPHA}({ALPHA}|{DIGIT}|_)*
- INT = (({NONZERO_DIGIT}+{DIGIT}*)|0)
- FLOAT = {INT}(\.{DIGIT}+)
- OPERATORS= = | \+ | - | \* | \/ | <-- | > | >= | < | <= | \!= | && | \|\| | \! | \^
- STRING_TEXT = [^\"]*

### Class Structure

A token is described with the class `Symbol`: for each token, a `Symbol` object stores the *type* of the token (IF,ID, etc.), the coordinates of the first character of the token in the sorce file, and lastly an optional `Object attribute` field.

The Lexer class generated by JFlex scans the input file and returns the recognized symbol, which is constructed by the method `constructSymbol(int type, int x, int y)`.  
If the type of the recognized token is *STRING*, then the method `constructSymbol(int type, int x, int y,Object string)` is called instead.  

The Lexer class returns a special *ERROR* token if no pattern matches the input read and a special *EMPTY* token if *EOF* is reached.
